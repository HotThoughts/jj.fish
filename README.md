jjnm

# Make some changes, then describe them
jjdm "feat: add new feature"

# Push to remote
jjgp
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow

```fish
# Start a new change
jjnm
# Equivalent to: jj new main

# Check what's changed
jjst
# Equivalent to: jj st

# View recent commits
jjll 5
# Equivalent to: jj log --limit 5

# Describe your changes
jjdm "fix: resolve issue with parsing"
# Equivalent to: jj describe -m "fix: resolve issue with parsing"

# Push to remote
jjgp
# Equivalent to: jj git push
```

### Git Integration

```fish

# Push a specific change
jjgpc @
# Equivalent to: jj git push --change @
```

### Exploring History

```fish
# View commit graph
jjl

# View specific revisions
jjlr main..@
# Equivalent to: jj log --revisions main..@

# Limited history view
jjll 10
# Equivalent to: jj log --limit 10
```

## How Abbreviations Work

Fish abbreviations expand when you press space or enter. For example:
1. Type `jjl`
2. Press space
3. Fish expands it to `jj log`
4. Continue typing your arguments

You can also see what an abbreviation expands to:
```fish
abbr --show jjl
# Shows: abbr jjl 'jj log'
```

## Customization

You can add your own jj abbreviations:

```fish
# Add custom abbreviations
abbr --add jjs 'jj show'
abbr --add jjco 'jj checkout'
abbr --add jjam 'jj abandon @'

# Remove abbreviations you don't want
abbr --erase jjnm
```

## Requirements

- **Fish shell**: Version 3.4.0 or later
- **jj (Jujutsu)**: Version 0.29.0 or later for full compatibility
- **Git**: Required for git integration features

The plugin will show warnings on startup if dependencies are missing, but core abbreviations will still work.

## Troubleshooting

### Abbreviations not working

```fish
fisher list | grep jj.fish

If not found, reinstall:

```fish
fisher install HotThoughts/jj.fish
```
